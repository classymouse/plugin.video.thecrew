Hello. This is a question regarding the library feature in the crew addon. When you search for a TV series, you can add it to the library and they all go into the crew folder. Kodi and the crew look for updates daily and each time a new episode is released, it's automatically added to the library.
The problem is that it only looks for new episodes and not new seasons. In other words let's say you already have 3 seasons of a show. You keep getting all new episodes to the end, but when a few months later season 4 is released, nothing happens and you'll have to manually add the whole series to your library for it to work.
This is not new. It's been like this for ages and I'm wondering if you're aware of it and if there's a way to fix it.
Thank you. (WCB)
